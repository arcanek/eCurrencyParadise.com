            One of the most convenient ways to spend your Bitcoin is by using a prepaid debit card.</p>
        
        <p>
            Bitpay offers a prepaid Visa card for $9.95.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            You pay for the card with Bitcoin, and fund it from your Bitcoin Wallet.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            There's no credit check, and the card is delivered to you in about a week.
        </p>    
        
        <p>
            The card is accepted wherever Visa is accepted.
