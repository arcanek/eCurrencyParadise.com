            Getting started with Bitcoin
        </p>
    
        <p>
            First, you need a wallet.
        </p>
        <p>
            A wallet is a place to store your Bitcoin.
        </p>
        <p>
            An online wallet allows you to access your Bitcoin over the Internet.
        </p>
        <p>
            An online or desktop wallet allows you to send and receive Bitcoin.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is the easiest wallet to set up.
        </p>
        <p>
            All you need is an e-mail adress.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The most popular wallet is from

            Bitcoin to Paypal
        </p>
        
        <p>
            All you need is a <a href="btcprepaiddebitcards.html">prepaid debit card</a> that you can fund with your Bitcoin wallet.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            You can get a card from BitPay. No need for photo ID, just your social security number, and $9.95 for the card, and they accept Bitcoin for payment.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            At Paypal, link your card to your Paypal account, and you can transfer funds. Linking the card only took me a few seconds.
